## History:
### 1. What is the name of your language?

##### Swift

### 2. When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need? 

##### Swift was introduced to the public by Apple at the 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference. The creation of the language began at the hands of Chris Lattner in 2010. The aim was to create a language that would be more user-friendly than the language previously used for Apple development - Objective-C.

### 3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.). If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.

##### Swift is used for the creation of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS apps.

### 4. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.

##### The Apple developer site and Swift site both have very useful resources for learning to use Swift.

## Getting Started (questions):
### 1. What did you need to do to install the language? 

##### I had to install the app Xcode on my Mac which has the latest release of Swift supported by Apple included. I also had to install simulators for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS in order to see the app come to life.

### 2. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using?

##### Yes, the website that I used (Swift) recommended downloading Xcode as the very first step. 

### 3. How do you run programs in that language?

##### Xcode uses SwiftUI to run Swift programs. SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit that creates apps in a "declarative way", meaning its purpose is to show the apps' own purpose as if a user is interacting with it.

### 4. How do you write comments in your language?

##### Comments in Swift are as follows:
